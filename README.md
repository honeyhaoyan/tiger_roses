# E.P.A : Energy Profile Prediction And Analysis

 It is a project that provides a solution for problem C MCM/ICM, 2018. And my teammates are Jiuqin Zhou, Hongyu Yan.
## Problem
 - **Problem**: Along the U.S. border with Mexico, there are four states – California (CA), Arizona (AZ), New Mexico (NM), and Texas (TX) – that wish to form a realistic new energy compact focused on increased usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources. Your team has been asked by the four governors of these states to perform data analysis and modeling to inform their development of a set of goals for their interstate energy compact.
 - The details are showed in 2018\_MCM\_Problem\_C.pdf
